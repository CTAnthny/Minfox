# Minfox

Minimal Firefox userChrome.css with minimum modifications.

I've decided to make minor edits to Firefox so it won't show all icons at  once on the right side of the address bar and a little less bloated on  the left side (removed unnecessary ones). Also removed the ugly line above the tab.

The good thing is that it has only several edits and should not break with Firefox updates.

**How to create the userChrome.css**

1. Open about:support page in Firefox
2. Click on "Profile Folder" > "Open Folder"
3. Create a new folder named "chrome"
4. Open the new folder
5. Create a file with name "userChrome.css"
6. Copy-paste the code from this repository or create new rules
7. Restart Firefox
